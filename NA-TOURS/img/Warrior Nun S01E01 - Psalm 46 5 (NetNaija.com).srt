[choir singing liturgical music]

2
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,265
[girl] My whole life,
I've dreamt about being dead.

3
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,477
I leave my body,
and I see myself from above.

4
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,606
A normal girl, just... normal.

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,276
I stare at her perfect normality
until I wake up

6
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,154
and realize that I'm still the freak
I've been my whole life.

7
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,782
One thing I've learned since then...

8
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,702
life has a really fucked-up way
of making your dreams come true.

9
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,412
[man] Tragic.

10
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,956
Such a young and pleasant face.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,167
The Devil may present a pleasing visage.

12
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,545
The better to seduce and influence
the weak-minded.

13
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,005
I see. So she was--

14
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,466
She will burn like those who spawned her.

15
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,051
[monk] You assume she is in Hell?

16
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,469
It wouldn't matter.

17
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,304
She was in Hell already.

18
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,475
Well, name,

19
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,104
age, cause of death for the book.

20
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,481
Ava Silva, 19.

21
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,652
-Leave the cause of death blank.
-I'm not supposed to--

22
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,239
I said leave it blank.

23
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,242
[sighs] As you wish.

[sighs]

26
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,335
Forgive me, Sister,
but I have to ask you to leave now

27
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,255
so I can attend to some urgent matters.

28
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:15,051
But please remember,
she cannot ask for forgiveness anymore,

29
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,928
so it's up to us to forgive her.

30
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,473
For God knows all and sees all

31
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,392
and will be thy judge.

32
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,814
I'll take my chances.

[woman 1] Monk!

38
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,765
I need somewhere to put her down.

39
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,184
[monk] Sister Shannon. Over here.

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,102

43
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,315
[Mary] Easy.

44
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,399
We're here.

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,318
[woman 3] I've got the surgeon.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,028
Divinium shrapnel.

47
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,322
You gotta get it all out
before it kills her.

48
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,535
[screams]

49
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,537
-How bad is it?
-Let her work, Lilith.

50
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,039
You're strong, girl.

51
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,790
You're gonna pull through.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710
Get the pieces out so she can heal.

53
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,503
Your organs are pierced.

54
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,047
Liver, spleen.

55
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,841
Several of these shards
are keeping you from bleeding out.

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,637
If I remove them, it could kill her.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,598
-Can you give her something for the pain?
-[woman 2 coughing]

58
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,434
We've seen worse, haven't we?

59
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,020
Mary.

60
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,856
Don't say it, Lilith.
Don't even think about it.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,442
You think I want this? It's not up to us.

62
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,652
There's a protocol.

-Mary. You know what needs to happen.

68
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,541
Beatrice, get her out of here
before I shoot her.

69
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,543
She's right.

70
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,754
This is Shannon.

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,924
She is our leader. She's our friend.

72
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,926
We are not gonna give up on her.

73
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,720
Mary, I'm not gonna make it.

74
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,848
Take it out.

You're ready.

91
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,069
We both know it.

Keep it safe,

96
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,212

Would you like water with that, Father?

730
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,360
[in Spanish] No, I'm not drinking it.
Just looking at it.

731
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,361
I understand.

732
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,825
You know...

733
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,288
Sometimes... it helps to share
what's on your mind.

734
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,791
You and I have the same job.

735
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,043
Listening.

736
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,088
So... Come on. [knocks]

737
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,719
[priest, in Spanish] How do I explain?

738
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,558
What if I told you that Demons were real?
That they were among us?

739
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,811
[air hissing]

740
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,689
[priest continues]
Some are...

741
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:21,111
ethereal monsters that feed off our souls
and push us to do evil.

742
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:26,116
[whooshing]

743
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,828
[whooshing, moaning]

744
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,622
[screeching]

745
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,875
[wailing]

746
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,963
[priest] Others are beasts from Hell
that could slice you in half

747
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,799
with a single swipe of their claw.

748
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,969
[clanking, clattering]

749
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,562
-[snarling, screeching]
-[slashing]

750
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,024
[priest] You would nod
your head and say you understand,

751
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,651
because I'm a priest.

752
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,694
You expect me to say these things.

753
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,494
Things that might be metaphorical
and not literal.

754
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,622
[no audible dialogue]

755
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,376
[priest]
But what if I weren't a priest?

756
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,171
What if I told you all this as a layman?

757
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,595
You would think that either
I was a madman or a prophet.

758
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,559
And these days,
it's very hard to believe in prophets.

759
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,996
[snarling]

760
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,507
[creature screeching, roaring]

761
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:12,139
[snarling]

762
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,952
[vocalizing]
